# Tic Tac Tow with AI

This is a implementation of the paper-and-pencil game from childhood: Tic-Tac-Toe, also known as Noughts and crosses or 
Xs and Os.

This project is from the **Jetbrain Academy** (https://www.jetbrains.com/academy/).
 
## Feature

It is possible to player the game with the AI, with three levels.

The "**easy**" level make will make random moves.

The "**medium**" level difficulty makes a move using the following process:

    1. If it can win in one move (if it has two in a row), it places a third to get three in a row and win.
    2. If the opponent can win in one move, it plays the third itself to block the opponent to win.
    3. Otherwise, it makes a random move. 

THe "**hard**" level difficulty implements the **Minimax** algorithm, this is the brute force algorithm that maximizes the 
value of the own position and minimizes the value of the opponent's position. Basically, it can see all possible 
outcomes till the end of the game and choose the best of them considering his opponent also would play perfectly. So, it 
does not rely on the blunders of the opponent, it plays perfectly regardless of the opponent's skill.

 
## Usage

Download the repository and run tic-tac-tow.py.

The main menu accept two commands: "start" and "exit". The "start" command takes two parameters: four parameters are 
possible for now: "user" to play as a human, and "easy", "medium" and "hard" to play as an easy level AI.
The command "exit" should simply terminate the program.

The first player use the "X" symbol, the secondo "O".

If any of the player is human, the user should input 2 numbers that represent the cell on which user wants to make his 
"X" or "O".

```
Input command: > start user hard
---------
|       |
|       |
|       |
---------
Enter the coordinates: (x y) > 2 2
